# Monita for Home Assistant rebrand

**Monita for Home Assistant** is the new product name for **Monita for Home Assistant**.

This rebrand is designed as an in-place upgrade, not a replacement integration.

## What users will see change

- Home Assistant integration name: **Monita for Home Assistant**
- HACS display name: **Monita for Home Assistant**
- setup, options, Repairs, diagnostics, and action-editor wording: **Monita**
- device manufacturer: **Monita**
- GitHub release titles: **Monita for Home Assistant**
- documentation and examples: **Monita**
- approved visual identity: the supplied Monita for Home Assistant branding

During the transition, documentation may include **formerly Monita for Home Assistant** to make the rename clear to existing users.

## What intentionally does not change in 1.3.0

The following technical identifiers are compatibility contracts and remain unchanged:

| Existing identifier | 1.3.0 behavior | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `monita` | Canonical | Home Assistant integration domain for new installations |
| `custom_components/monita` | Canonical | Active Monita custom component implementation |
| `monita.send` | Canonical | Monita automation/action namespace |
| historical integration domain | Compatibility only | Keeps config entries created before the canonical Monita domain loadable during migration |
| `homeassistant::monita` | Compatibility only | Accepted only for historical loop-prevention metadata; new messages use `homeassistant::monita` |
| Stored config entries | Retained | No delete/re-add process |
| Entity unique IDs | Retained | Dashboards and automations keep their entity registry relationships |
| Application/client tokens | Retained | No credential reset solely because of the rename |
| Native pairing credentials | Retained | Existing paired bridges do not need to be rebuilt |

A future technical namespace migration, if ever introduced, must include an explicit migration layer and compatibility period. A brand rename alone is not sufficient reason to break existing Home Assistant YAML.

## Existing automations

This remains valid after the rebrand:

```yaml
action:
  - action: monita.send
    data:
      title: "Front Door"
      message: "Person detected."
      priority: 9
      image_entity: camera.front_door
```

The Home Assistant action editor and technical action ID are both Monita-native: `monita.send`. The historical integration domain is retained only for existing-install compatibility.

## Server/API terminology

Monita continues to use the established compatible HTTP/WebSocket contracts used by this integration.

Documentation retains the word **Monita** only when it is technically necessary to describe:

- upstream/legacy Monita API compatibility
- an established API header or wire-format convention
- legacy product/version history in the changelog
- compatibility identifiers that cannot be renamed without breaking upgrades

Those references do not represent the active product name.

## Visual identity
